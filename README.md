# EE4740-Modulo-Compressed-Sensing-on-Image
Lecture Project of EE4740 Data Compression: Entropy and Sparsity Perspectives

Use Modulo compressed sensing algorithm (MILP) and OMP to recover the sparsity image

Author: Yanqi Hong, Kaishen Lin


Explanation: 

              Test_MILP_OMP_M.m, Test_MILP_M_S.m, and Test_MILP_OMP_L.m are the code to run the experiment
             
              omp.m and MILP.m are the Matlab functions for OMP and MILP algorithms, respectively.


_**Comment:**_ If the Matlab reports: 


            The index exceeds the number of array elements. The index cannot exceed 0.

Try to run the test file again or increase the maximum solving time in MILP.m
